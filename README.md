### Exploratory analysis of The Top 1000 IMDb movies dataset
This is an SQL portfolio project showcasing various SQL techniques, including data cleaning, window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, and aggregation functions.

The Top 1000 IMDb movies dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows) is used in this demonstration, utilizing MySQL for analysis.
